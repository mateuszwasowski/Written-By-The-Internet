        <p class="text">  Stallman, to this day, refuses to acknowledge 
any home before Currier House, the dorm he lived in during his days at 
Harvard. He has also been known to describe leaving that home in 
tragicomic terms. Once, while describing his years at Harvard, Stallman 
said his only regret was getting kicked out. It wasn't until I asked 
Stallman what precipitated his ouster, that I realized I had walked into
 a classic Stallman setup line.The word "home" is a weighted term in the
 Stallman lexicon. In a pointed swipe at his parents, Stallman, to this 
day, refuses to acknowledge any home before Currier House, the dorm he 
lived in during his days at Harvard. He has also been known to describe 
leaving that home in tragicomic terms. Once, while describing his years

        <p class="text">  Stallman's social universe imploded. Like an 
astronaut experiencing the aftereffects of zero-gravity, Stallman found 
that his ability to interact with nonhackers, especially female 
nonhackers, had atrophied significantly. After 16 weeks in the AI Lab, 
the self confidence he'd been quietly accumulating during his 4 years at
 Harvard was virtually gone.</p>
